Here is (1) an example of a TIA15 Simatic 1214c version 3 project. The project contains a web server, (2) the index file is in a separate folder. (3) Powershell script for HTTP POST request that turns one PLC relay output on and off. The script performs login and logout. ATTENTION! PLC authorization DOES NOT WORK in Chrome, even after installing the PLC certificate. Use Firefox. Remember that you must be logged in to control the relay output. To enable/disable the relay output, the ps script sends two web forms to the PLC after authorization. The IP address in the script is the same as the controller address in the TIA project.
